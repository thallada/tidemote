# Tidemote

A sealed biosphere of hundreds of thousands to millions of particles, simulated on the GPU with WebGPU. Inert silt is charged into glint by the tide. Cells photosynthesise, graze, hunt and scavenge, and build their children out of silt. Children mutate into new species, bonded species grow into multicellular bodies, and the climate turns every 10–18 minutes. Leave it running and it keeps changing for hours.

It grew out of [proximity-structures](https://github.com/thallada/proximity-structures): simple elements that only react to what is near them, scaled up until complex structure appears.

## Running it

Open `dist/tidemote.html` in a browser with WebGPU: a current Chrome or Edge, a recent Safari, or Firefox on Windows. It is a single self-contained file with no build step needed to view it. Some browsers block WebGPU on `file://` pages; if so, serve the folder:

```sh
python3 -m http.server -d dist 8000   # then open http://localhost:8000/tidemote.html
```

On start it sizes the universe to your GPU: it times a few frames and fixes the particle count so the simulation fits in about 7.5 ms a frame. If the frame rate later drops, it lowers the render resolution instead of the particle count.

Press **H** in the page for controls and **K** for the Field Lab (species list, composition, population charts, lineage tree, chronicle, environment overlays and a field guide). Click any cell to follow it.

## Building

The source is a handful of ES modules in `src/`. `build.mjs` uses esbuild to bundle `src/main.js` into a readable IIFE, inserts it into `src/page.html`, and writes `dist/tidemote.html`:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

esbuild preserves module scope, so top-level names can be reused across files.

## Layout

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/shaders.js` | All WGSL: the simulation passes (binning, counting sort, matter, life), picking, point and bond rendering, post-processing. `DEFAULT_K` holds every tunable constant. |
| `src/engine.js` | The WebGPU engine: buffers, pipelines, the per-frame pass sequence, census and pick readbacks, the focus/highlight filter, and the CPU-side regulators (plant-cover turbidity, guild blight, immigration). |
| `src/genome.js` | CPU genome helpers: founding archetypes, packing and decoding, colours, affinities, role shares, and diet/mobility guilds. |
| `src/climate.js` | Shared seasons, climate eras and abiogenesis rules. |
| `src/main.js` | The page: calibration, camera, inspector, organism tracing, species registry and naming, census panel, input. |
| `src/lab.js` | The Field Lab drawer. |
| `src/guide.js` | Glossary (hover hints) and field-guide text. |
| `src/page.html` | Markup and styles. The bundled script is inserted at `/*__SCRIPT__*/`. |
| `tools/sim.mjs`, `tools/compare.mjs` | Headless ecology runs and comparisons across seeds (see below). |

## How the simulation works

Each frame runs entirely on the GPU:

1. **Resolve** last frame's claims (meals, births, bites) and count each species.
2. **Bin** every particle into a grid with a counting sort and prefix scan, so neighbours can be found in the surrounding 3×3 cells.
3. **Matter**: silt, glint and husks drift on divergence-free currents. The tide charges silt into glint, glint fades, and husks decay.
4. **Life**: only the living are dispatched, indirectly. Each cell sums particle-life forces from 8-dimensional surface/receptor signatures, bonds to its two nearest same-species neighbours if it is adhesive, photosynthesises, pays upkeep, and claims food or a silt grain to divide into.

Every 20 frames a census is read back: per-species counts and genomes. The CPU uses it to name species, track lineages, and nudge the few global regulators that keep the ecosystem diverse:

- species blight
- guild blight
- plant-cover turbidity
- immigration of rare ways of life

The field guide inside the page explains the ecology in full.

## Tuning the ecology headlessly

Install dependencies at the repo root with `npm install`. `tools/sim.mjs` runs the page's ecology, including climate eras, crisis recovery and immigration, without rendering or real-time pacing. Defaults: 8192 particles, 10 simulated minutes, samples every 5 simulated seconds and stdout every 30 seconds.

Use `--chrome` on machines without a GPU: headless Chromium runs WebGPU through SwiftShader, with `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM` available to override the executable (the cached Chromium build is tried before Playwright's default). On real GPUs, omit `--chrome` to use Dawn (`webgpu`); `--cpu` selects Mesa lavapipe for Dawn, whose async readbacks can corrupt memory and abort longer runs on GPU-less machines.

```sh
node tools/sim.mjs --chrome --n 4096 --minutes 10 --seed 11 --out run.json
node tools/sim.mjs --k '{"guildCap":0.4,"bite":0.08}' --out run.json
node tools/sim.mjs --minutes 1 --png world.png
node tools/compare.mjs --chrome --seeds 4 --minutes 10 --n 8192 --jobs 2 --out runs/ base '{}' noimm '{"immigration":false}'
```

`--no-eras` and `--no-immigration` disable those rules; `--sample` and `--print` set simulated-second intervals. JSON contains config, samples (composition, diversity, ledger rates per simulated minute and climate), eras, immigrants and summary metrics. Metrics requiring observations after 60 seconds are `null` in shorter runs. Shares are fractions of living cells. `--png` renders the final frame with Dawn only; optional `ZOOM=1,4` writes separate zoom images. `--help` lists the CLI options.

Comparison configs accept `k` overrides, `eras` and `immigration` booleans. Runs use seeds 1 through `--seeds`, run up to `--jobs` children, save each JSON, and print means ± sample standard deviations plus per-seed results. Dawn runs limit lavapipe threads per child; Chromium's SwiftShader manages its own threads. Run the smoke test and unit tests with `npm test`; the smoke test uses Chromium when an executable is available and otherwise falls back to Dawn with `--cpu`.
